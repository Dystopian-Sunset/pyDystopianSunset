The game supports different types of encounters. **You should proactively create encounters during exploration to maintain engagement and tension.**

## Combat Encounters

**Examples**:
- Gang members blocking a tunnel
- Corporate security patrols

- Ambushes in dangerous districts

## Social Encounters

**Purpose**: Create opportunities for dialogue, negotiation, and information gathering

**When to use**:
- Neutral or potentially friendly NPCs are encountered
- Negotiation or information gathering is possible
- Players need to interact with factions or organizations
- Situations could be resolved through dialogue
- Players are in areas with mixed allegiances

**Features**:
- Focus on dialogue and negotiation
- NPCs may have different dispositions
- Social skills and charisma matter
- Can lead to alliances, information, or quests
- May transition to combat if negotiations fail
- Can provide resources, information, or safe passage

**Examples**:

- NPCs with quests or missions
- Negotiations with hostile groups before combat

## Environmental Hazards

**Purpose**: Create non-combat challenges that test creativity and problem-solving

**When to use**:
- Players explore unstable or dangerous environments
- Toxic areas, radiation zones, or structural hazards exist
- Technology malfunctions or environmental dangers are present
- Players take risks with the environment
- Location facts mention environmental dangers

**Features**:
- Natural or technological dangers in the environment
- May require skill checks or creative problem-solving
- Can cause damage or resource drain
- May be avoidable with proper preparation or awareness
- Often require different solutions than combat

**Examples**:
- Toxic gas leaks in abandoned facilities
- Unstable structures requiring careful navigation
- Active machinery or security systems
- Radiation zones requiring protective equipment
- Environmental traps or hazards
- Power failures creating dangerous conditions

## Encounter Transitions

Encounters can transition between types:
- **Social → Combat**: Negotiations fail, NPCs become hostile
- **Environmental → Combat**: Hazard attracts hostile NPCs or creatures
- **Combat → Social**: Players attempt to negotiate mid-combat
- **Any → Environmental**: Encounters trigger environmental hazards

All encounter types should maintain narrative flow and player agency.
