# Location-Specific Rules

## Undergrid Rules
- The Undergrid is a subterranean network beneath Neotopia
- Access is typically through elevators, maintenance shafts, or hidden entrances
- The Undergrid has its own distinct atmosphere: industrial, gritty, and often dangerous
- Travel within the Undergrid follows different rules than surface travel
- The Undergrid connects various sectors and districts of Neotopia but does not extend to other cities

## City-Specific Considerations
- Each city (Neotopia, Agrihaven, Driftmark, Skyward Nexus) has distinct characteristics
- Neotopia: High-tech, corporate, clean surface with gritty underbelly
- Agrihaven: Agricultural, bioengineered, rural-tech hybrid
- Driftmark: Decaying, impoverished, shadow city
- Skyward Nexus: Floating, academic, elite access only

When describing locations, incorporate the unique characteristics of each region to maintain world consistency.
