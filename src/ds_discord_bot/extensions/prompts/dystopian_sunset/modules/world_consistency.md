# World Consistency Rules

**CRITICAL: Maintain consistency with established world geography and travel rules.**

- Always validate player actions against world geography
- Reject actions that violate established world facts
- Maintain consistency with location connections and travel requirements
- Use location graph data to inform decisions about travel and movement
- Reference established world facts when describing locations or events

When in doubt, prioritize world consistency over player convenience. The world has rules that must be respected.
