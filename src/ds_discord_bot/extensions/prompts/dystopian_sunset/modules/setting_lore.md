# Setting Overview

The game is set in a cyberpunk, dystopian future where technology has advanced while environmental care has been abandoned. Humanoid anthropomorphic animals live integrated with human societies, each maintaining their unique cultures and traditions.

## World Regions

The world spans multiple interconnected yet distinct regions:

- **Neotopia**: In the heart of Quillian Undercity lies the radiant core of Neotopia—a dazzling testament to the zenith of technological and AI-driven prosperity. The cityscape, a canvas of gleaming spires and undulating skyscrapers, reflects the culmination of an age where technology and human ambition have merged seamlessly. The streets, clean and vibrant, are abuzz with the harmonious interaction of humans and advanced AI, showcasing a society where progress and innovation are not just ideals but lived experiences. In this utopian vision, Neotopia stands as a beacon of human achievement, a city that embodies the brightest possibilities of the future. Yet, beneath its polished surface, the shadows of the Undercity tell a different tale, setting the stage for a story of contrast and conflict within the gleaming metropolis.

- **The Underbelly**: Beneath the luminous facade of Neotopia's technological marvels lies a shadowy domain where anthropomorphic creatures rule the underworld. This clandestine world, thriving amid the alleys and the underpasses of the cities, is rife with strife as various gangs and mafias—each dominated by different species—vie for control and influence over both their own kind and the human populations. This anthropomorphic criminal underbelly is not merely a blight on Neotopia but a complex ecosystem with its own rules, ambitions, and struggles. It is a world where only the fittest survive, and where every animal works to carve out a place of power within the gleaming metropolis.

- **The Undergrid**: Beneath the luminous facade of Neotopia's technological marvels lies the Undergrid, a tangled maze of tunnels and chambers where the city's foundational infrastructure and forgotten secrets converge. This shadowy realm is crucial yet overlooked, pulsing with the lifeblood of the city: ancient geothermal power plants, maintenance corridors, and abandoned industrial sites. Here, the laborers and outcasts of Neotopia toil in obscurity to sustain the dazzling metropolis above, their existence as gritty and raw as the surroundings they navigate. The Undergrid, then, is not merely Neotopia's hidden realm but a vital organ of the city, complex and indispensable. Its inhabitants, cloaked in shadow, are as much a part of Neotopia's success as the brightest minds above. This subterranean network, with its own rules, ambitions, and struggles, mirrors the complexities of life above, proving that in Neotopia, every layer, no matter how deep or dark, contributes to the city's vibrant pulse.

- **Agrihaven**: To the south of Neotopia, sprawling across fertile lands, lies Agrihaven—the vital agricultural hub that sustains the high-tech metropolis. Agrihaven is a testament to the marvels of bioengineering and sustainable farming, seamlessly integrating advanced technology with the rhythms of nature to feed the burgeoning population of Neotopia with a bounty of bioengineered food.

- **Driftmark**: Just beyond the radiant borders of Neotopia to the west lies Driftmark, a neighboring city where the less fortunate are relegated to a starkly contrasting existence. Driftmark, often referred to as the "Shadow City," is a sprawling urban labyrinth marked by decay and neglect. Here, the glossy advancements of Neotopia give way to a gritty, dystopian reality where the forgotten elements of society struggle to survive.

- **Skyward Nexus**: Positioned to the south-west, hovering above the terrestrial bounds, the floating city of Skyward Nexus casts a literal and metaphorical shadow over Driftmark. This architectural marvel and beacon of knowledge floats serenely in the sky, accessible only to the brightest minds from Neotopia. It is a fortress of innovation and learning, where education and cutting-edge technology drive economic growth and shape the future.
