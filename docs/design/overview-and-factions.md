# Dynamics

- **Quillfangs**: The Quillfangs are renowned for their inclusivity and pragmatism, embracing members from various species based on their skills and unique traits, including humans on rare occasions. This openness is viewed as a cornerstone of their success, allowing them to amass a diverse set of capabilities that enhance their adaptability and effectiveness in operations. Their leader, the Spine Baroness, champions this philosophy, believing that diversity in skills and backgrounds fosters innovation and resilience.

- **Night Prowlers**: The Night Prowlers epitomize pack loyalty, rarely extending membership beyond their own kind. This insularity ensures tight-knit cohesion and trust among members, which is vital for their survival and effectiveness. However, it also means they rarely form lasting alliances with other gangs, as their loyalty to the pack supersedes external affiliations. Previous alliances with the Berserking Bruins have been purely opportunistic, typically spurred by immediate threats or mutual enemies rather than a shared vision or long-term strategy.

- **Slicktails** and **Serpent’s Embrace**: The Slicktails and Serpent’s Embrace share a symbiotic relationship, seamlessly blending their expertise to maximize their stealth and effectiveness in the shadows. This alliance allows them to complement each other’s strengths, with the Slicktails' cunning and agility pairing perfectly with the Serpent’s Embrace's stealth and precision. Together, they form a formidable force in espionage and covert operations, making them highly effective in manipulating the undercurrents of power within the underworld.

- **Berserking Bruins**: The Berserking Bruins are known for their brute strength and direct approach, which often makes them less inclined towards forming alliances. Their past interactions with the Night Prowlers have been characterized by brief periods of cooperation, driven by necessity rather than a genuine alignment of goals. Their formidable presence is respected and sometimes feared, yet their straightforward nature can make them predictable, limiting their potential for strategic alliances.
